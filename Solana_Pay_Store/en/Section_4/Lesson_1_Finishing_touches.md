Congrats. You're well on your way to becoming an e-commerce tycoon. Jeff Bezos who? 

### üö¢ Moving to the mainnet
My favourite part about this project is how there's **no deploy cost.** ANYONE can "deploy" this project for free and start generating income by selling their stuff. To start accepting transactions on the mainnet, you'll just have to update two variables. 

1. The "USDC" token address in `createTransaction.js`. The mainnet USDC SPL token address is `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v`, so your statement should look like this:
```jsx
const usdcAddress = new PublicKey("EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v");
```
2. The `network` enum on `WalletAdapterNetwork` on `_app.js` and `createTransaction.js`:
```jsx
const network = WalletAdapterNetwork.Mainnet;
```

Ta-da! Your app is now taking **real money** on the mainnet. Magical.

### üöÄ Deploy to the world (GTFOL)
Deploying a React app has gotten so easy that there is no reason not to do it at this point lol. Plus, it's free. You've made it this far, deploying is the final step. Plus -- your fellow builders at buildspace must not be deprived of your NFTs!! Please give us the opportunity to mint your rare creations hehe.

**Note:** Since Vercel is a read-only filesystem, adding orders or products from the web-app **will not work!**. This is cuz your "database" json files will not save. If you don't want to use Vercel, all good. Use whatever you want.

Basically:

- Push your latest code up to Github. 
- Connect Vercel to your repo.
- Make sure you add your .env variables
- Deploy.
- Done.

Note: On Vercel, you will need to add 6th environment variable CI=false. This will make sure our build doesn't fail because of warnings.

### üòç Hello, Solana Master
Super exciting that you made it to the end. Pretty big deal!! Solana is super early and very powerful and you've now gotten your hands dirty w/ the core tech. Hell yes. You have all the skills you need now to build your own Gumroad.

Thank you for contributing to the future of web3 by learning this stuff. The fact that you know how this works and how to code it up is a superpower. Use your power wisely ;).

### üåà Before you head out
Go to #showcase in Discord and drop us a link to your final product that we can mess around with :).

Also, you should totally tweet out your final project and show the world your epic creation! What you did wasn't easy by any means. Maybe even make a little video showing off your project and attach that to the tweet. Make your tweet look pretty and show off!!

And if you feel up to it, tag @_buildspace :). It gives us a ton of motivation whenever we see people ship their projects. Plus, you can inspire someone else to get into Solana.

Give us that dopamine hit pls.

Lastly, what would also be awesome is if you told us in #feedback how you liked this project and the structure of the project. What did you love most about buildspace? What sucked? What would like us to change for future projects? Your feedback would be awesome!

See yah around!!!
