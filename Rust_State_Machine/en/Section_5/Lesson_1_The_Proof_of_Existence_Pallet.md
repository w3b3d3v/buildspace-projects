# The Proof of Existence Pallet

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MEr54_-AI)

In this section, we will create a Proof of Existence Pallet.

We will take advantage of all the refactoring we have done so far to make it very simple to integrate this new Pallet into our existing Runtime.

There are no new concepts to learn in this section, however it will test that you understand and can reproduce all the steps and concepts learned in the previous sections.

# Proof of Existence Pallet

We have gone a long way since we built our very first Balances Pallet.

The structure of our Runtime and Pallets have evolved quite a bit since.

- Generic Types
- Config Trait
- Nested Dispatch
- and more...

This will be the last pallet we build for this tutorial, but we will build it knowing all of the tips and tricks we have learned so far.

The goal here is for you to ensure that all of the intricacies of Pallet development is well understood and that you are able to navigate all of the Rust code.

## What is Proof of Existence?

The Proof of Existence Pallet uses the blockchain to provide a secure and immutable ledger that can be used to verify the existence of a particular document, file, or piece of data at a specific point in time.

Because the blockchain acts as an immutable ledger whose history cannot be changed, when some data is placed on the blockchain, it can be referenced at a future time to show that some data already existed in the past.

For example, imagine you knew the outcome of the next Presidential Election., but before you reveal it, you want to make sure that you prove that you had discovered it at a certain time. You could put some sort of data on the blockchain which represents the cure you found, and then later, when you get your research reviewed and published,

Normally, you would not put the raw contents of your claim on the blockchain but a [hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of the data, which is both smaller and obfuscates the data in your claim before you are ready to reveal it.

However, for the purposes of this tutorial, we won't introduce hash functions yet.

## Pallet Structure

The `BTreeMap` is again the best tool to use for storing data in this Pallet. However, you will notice that the construction of the storage is a bit different than before. Rather than having a map from accounts to some data, we will actually map the content we want to claim to the user who owns it.

This construction of `content -> account` allows an account to be the owner of multiple different claims, but having each claim only be owned by one user.

# Exercises:

### Create Your Pallet

Let's start to create this pallet:

1. Create a new file for your Proof of Existence Pallet.

	```bash
	touch src/proof_of_existence.rs
	```

2. Copy the contents from the template into your new file.
```rust
use core::fmt::Debug;
use std::collections::BTreeMap;

pub trait Config: crate::system::Config {
	/// The type which represents the content that can be claimed using this pallet.
	/// Could be the content directly as bytes, or better yet the hash of that content.
	/// We leave that decision to the runtime developer.
	type Content: Debug + Ord;
}

/// This is the Proof of Existence Module.
/// It is a simple module that allows accounts to claim existence of some data.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Pallet<T: Config> {
	/// A simple storage map from content to the owner of that content.
	/// Accounts can make multiple different claims, but each claim can only have one owner.
	/* TODO: Add a field `claims` which is a `BTreeMap` fom `T::Content` to `T::AccountId`. */
}

impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
	/// Create a new instance of the Proof of Existence Module.
	pub fn new() -> Self {
		/* TODO: Return a new instance of the `Pallet` struct. */
	}
}
```

3. Complete the `TODO`s to add a storage to your new pallet and allow it to be initialized.

4. In your `main.rs` file, import the `proof_of_existence` module.

Make sure that everything compiles after you complete these steps.

On `main.rs`:

```rust
mod balances;
/* TODO: Import the `proof_of_existence` module. */
mod support;
mod system;
```
