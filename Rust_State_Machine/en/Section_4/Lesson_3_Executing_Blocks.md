# Executing Blocks

We will now start the process to replace the simple block simulation in our `main` function with a proper block execution pipeline.

## Execute Block

[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWmSo6tfeog)

We have introduced a new function to our `Runtime` called `fn execute_block`.

The steps of this function is exactly the same as our current `main` function, but using the concrete `Block` type we defined to extract details like the expected block number and the extrinsics that we want to execute.

### Iterating Over a Vector

In order to build our `execute_block` function, we will need to iterate over all the extrinsics in our block, and dispatch those calls. In rust, the common way to access the elements of a vector is to turn it into an iterator.

There are two functions used for turning a vector into an interator, `iter` and `into_iter`, and their difference lies in ownership:

- `iter`: This method creates an iterator that borrows each element from the vector, allowing you to read the values without taking ownership. It's useful when you want to iterate over the vector while keeping it intact.

- `into_iter`: This method consumes the vector, transferring ownership of each element to the iterator. It's handy when you want to move or transfer ownership of the vector's elements to another part of your code. After using `into_iter`, the original vector can't be used anymore, as ownership has been transferred.

In our context, we want to use `into_iter()`, so you will get something that looks like:

```rust
for support::Extrinsic { caller, call } in block.extrinsics.into_iter() {
	// do stuff with `caller` and `call`
}
```

Here you can see we also do a trick to separate out the fields of the `Extrinsic` in a single line, since ultimately we want to work with `caller` and `call`. You can of course break this process up into multiple lines if you want.

### Dispatching a Call

Once we have the `call` and `caller`, what should we do with them?

This is where the `Dispatch` trait starts to come into play. You will see in our template, we included the shell of an `unimplemented()` `fn dispatch`. We will write this logic in the next step, but we need to already use the `dispatch` function in our `execute_block` logic.

Once we have the `call` and `caller`, we want to pass them to the `dispatch` logic, which you see is implemented on the `Runtime`.

That will look something like:

```rust
let _res = self.dispatch(caller, call).map_err(|e| eprintln!("{}", e));
```

Note that in Rust, if you want to access a function within a trait, like we do here with `dispatch`, you need to explicitly import that trait into your project.

We left a `TODO` at the top of `main.rs` where we ask you to import `crate::support::Dispatch`, which will allow you access to calling `dispatch` on `Runtime`.

### Better Error Messages

Since this is a more permanent function of our project, it also makes sense to expand the message being printed when there are extrinsic errors. For example:

```rust
eprintln!(
	"Extrinsic Error\n\tBlock Number: {}\n\tExtrinsic Number: {}\n\tError: {}",
	block.header.block_number, i, e
)
```

This allows you to see the block number, extrinsic number, and the error message whenever there is an extrinsic error. This can be very helpful when you have many blocks being imported each with potentially many extrinsics.

To get the extrinsic number `i`, use you chain the [`enumerate()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.enumerate) function after the `into_iter()`.

# Exercises:

### Build Your Execute Block Function

You should now have all the tools and information needed to successfully write your `execute_block` function.

Follow the `TODO`s provided by the template, and make sure to include the `impl crate::support::Dispatch for Runtime` that we provided for you, and that we will implement in the next steps.

On `main.rs`:

```rust
mod balances;
mod support;
mod system;

/* TODO: Import `crate::support::Dispatch` so that you can access the `dispatch` function. */

/// ... previous code.

// These are all the calls which are exposed to the world.
// Note that it is just an accumulation of the calls exposed by each module.
pub enum RuntimeCall {
	// TODO: Not implemented yet.
}

// This is our main Runtime.
// It accumulates all of the different pallets we want to use.
#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct Runtime {
	system: system::Pallet<Self>,
	balances: balances::Pallet<Self>,
}

impl system::Config for Runtime {
	type AccountId = types::AccountId;
	type BlockNumber = types::BlockNumber;
	type Nonce = types::Nonce;
}

impl balances::Config for Runtime {
	type Balance = types::Balance;
}

impl Runtime {
	// Create a new instance of the main Runtime, by creating a new instance of each pallet.
	fn new() -> Self {
		Self { system: system::Pallet::new(), balances: balances::Pallet::new() }
	}

	// Execute a block of extrinsics. Increments the block number.
	fn execute_block(&mut self, block: types::Block) -> support::DispatchResult {
		/* TODO:
			- Increment the system's block number.
			- Check that the block number of the incoming block matches the current block number,
			  or return an error.
			- Iterate over the extrinsics in the block...
				- Increment the nonce of the caller.
				- Dispatch the extrinsic using the `caller` and the `call` contained in the extrinsic.
				- Handle errors from `dispatch` same as we did for individual calls: printing any
				  error and capturing the result.
				- You can extend the error message to include information like the block number and
				  extrinsic number.
		*/
		Ok(())
	}
}

//also ADD THIS CODE TO YOUR main.rs file:
impl crate::support::Dispatch for Runtime {
	type Caller = <Runtime as system::Config>::AccountId;
	type Call = RuntimeCall;
	// Dispatch a call on behalf of a caller. Increments the caller's nonce.
	//
	// Dispatch allows us to identify which underlying module call we want to execute.
	// Note that we extract the `caller` from the extrinsic, and use that information
	// to determine who we are executing the call on behalf of.
	fn dispatch(
		&mut self,
		caller: Self::Caller,
		runtime_call: Self::Call,
	) -> support::DispatchResult {
		unimplemented!();
	}
}

/// ... previous code.
```

Executing blocks is a fundamental aspect of blockchain functionality, and you've now taken a significant step towards mastering this process. Well done on reaching this milestone!
