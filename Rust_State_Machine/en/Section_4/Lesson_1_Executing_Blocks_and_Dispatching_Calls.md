# Executing Blocks and Dispatching Calls

In this next section, you will construct the core pipeline used to interact with your state machine.

We will create the block structure which contains the transactions for your state transition function, and then the function dispatch pipeline to route those transactions to the appropriate function calls.

The goal of this section is to make your existing state machine resemble a blockchain that can be extended and upgraded.

# Add Our Support Module

In this step, we will introduce a `support` module to help bring in various types and traits that we will use to enhance our simple state machine.

## Constructing a Block

The first set of primitives provided by the `support` module are a set of structs that we need to construct a simple `Block`.

### The Block

A block is basically broken up into two parts: the header and a vector of extrinsics.

You can see that we keep the `Block` completely generic over the `Header` and `Extrinsic` type. The exact contents and definitions of these sub-types may change, but the generic `Block` struct can always be used.

#### The Header

The block header contains metadata about the block which is used to verify that the block is valid. In our simple state machine, we only store the blocknumber in the header, but real blockchains like Polkadot have:

- Parent Hash
- Block Number
- State Root
- Extrinsics Root
- Consensus Digests / Logs

#### The Extrinsic

In our simple state machine, an extrinsics is synonymous with user transactions.

Thus our extrinsic type is composed of a `Call` (the function we will execute) and a `Caller` (the account that wants to execute that function).

The Polkadot SDK supports other kinds of extrinsics beyond a user transactions, which is why it is called an `Extrinsic`, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

## Dispatching Calls

The next key change we are going to make to our simple state machine is to handle function dispatching. Basically, you can imagine that there could be multiple different pallets in your system, each with different calls they want to expose.

Your runtime, acting as a single entrypoint for your whole state transition function needs to be able to route incoming calls to the appropriate functions. For this, we need the `Dispatchable` trait.

You will see how this is used near the end of this tutorial.

### Dispatch Result

One last thing we added to the support module was a simple definition of the `Result` type that we want all dispatchable calls to return. This is exactly the type we already used for the `fn transfer` function, and allows us to return `Ok(())` if everything went well, or `Err("some error message")` if something went wrong.

# Exercises:

### Create the Support Module

Now that you understand what is in the support module, add it to your project.

1. Create the `support.rs` file:

	```bash
	touch src/support.rs
	```

2. Copy and paste the content provided into your file.
3. Import the support module at the top of your `main.rs` file.
4. Finally, replace your `Result<(), &'static str>` with `crate::support::DispatchResult` in the `fn transfer` function in your Balances Pallet.

Create file `src/support.rs`:

```rust
/// The most primitive representation of a Blockchain block.
pub struct Block<Header, Extrinsic> {
	/// The block header contains metadata about the block.
	pub header: Header,
	/// The extrinsics represent the state transitions to be executed in this block.
	pub extrinsics: Vec<Extrinsic>,
}

/// We are using an extremely simplified header which only contains the current block number.
/// On a real blockchain, you would expect to also find:
/// - parent block hash
/// - state root
/// - extrinsics root
/// - etc...
pub struct Header<BlockNumber> {
	pub block_number: BlockNumber,
}

/// This is an "extrinsic": literally an external message from outside of the blockchain.
/// This simplified version of an extrinsic tells us who is making the call, and which call they are
/// making.
pub struct Extrinsic<Caller, Call> {
	pub caller: Caller,
	pub call: Call,
}

/// The Result type for our runtime. When everything completes successfully, we return `Ok(())`,
/// otherwise return a static error message.
pub type DispatchResult = Result<(), &'static str>;

/// A trait which allows us to dispatch an incoming extrinsic to the appropriate state transition
/// function call.
pub trait Dispatch {
	/// The type used to identify the caller of the function.
	type Caller;
	/// The state transition function call the caller is trying to access.
	type Call;

	/// This function takes a `caller` and the `call` they want to make, and returns a `Result`
	/// based on the outcome of that function call.
	fn dispatch(&mut self, caller: Self::Caller, call: Self::Call) -> DispatchResult;
}
```


On `main.rs`:

```rust
mod balances;
/* TODO: Add the support module here. */
mod system;
```
