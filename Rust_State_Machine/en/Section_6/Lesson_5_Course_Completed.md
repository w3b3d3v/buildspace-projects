## Congratulations! You are a Rust superhero!

If you‚Äôve reached this point, having completed all the lessons and built your first blockchain using Rust from scratch, you are among the elite few who have accomplished this feat. Congratulations on this incredible achievement! Let's recap our journey: we created our blockchain using the pallets infrastructure, each responsible for specific functions. We developed the Balances pallet for managing user accounts and the Proof of Existence pallet for creating and revoking claims. We utilized macros to generate code efficiently, significantly reducing redundancy. This is just the beginning; there's much more to explore and learn.

## Next Steps to Becoming a Full-Time Rust Developer in the Polkadot Ecosystem

Now that you've laid a solid foundation, you're ready to dive deeper into the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk). By examining the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) code, especially the Substrate and Frame frameworks, you'll notice the parallels with what we've built. Each pallet, whether it's for Collective, Contracts, or Democracy, follows the same principles we've practiced. You'll see familiar structures, extensive use of macros, and comprehensive configurations. 

To advance further, consider enrolling in the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/). This rigorous and competitive program will elevate your skills, making you a sought-after Rust and blockchain developer. With guidance from industry leaders like Gavin Wood, you'll delve into modules on Polkadot, parachains, Frame, and more, preparing you for a stellar career in the blockchain space. Register your interest and join the next cohort to continue your journey towards becoming a Polkadot expert.
