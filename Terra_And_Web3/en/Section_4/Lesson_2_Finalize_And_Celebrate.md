### üòç Hello, Terra Master
Super exciting that you made it to the end. Pretty big deal!! Terra is super early and very powerful and you've now gotten your hands dirty w/ the core tech. Hell yes. You have all the core skills to now go and build whatever you want.

Thank you for contributing to the future of web3 by learning this stuff. The fact that you know how this works and how to code it up is a superpower. Use your power wisely ;).

### üåà Before you head out
Now that you're all done, wanna see if you can beat my score? I'm trynna get as many players as I can on here :D

Go to #showcase in Discord and drop us a link to your final product that we can mess around with :).

Also, you should totally tweet out your final project and show the world your epic creation! What you did wasn't easy by any means. Also, when you get your NFT be sure to save the file to your computer and attach it to your tweet directly. Looks better that way ;).

We made sure to make the NFT look super cool so you can impress the Twitter-verse!!

It may sounds weird, but, you being excited about your NFT and Terra on Twitter will likely inspire tons of other devs get into this stuff as well!

Be sure to tag @_buildspace :). We'll RT you!

Give us that dopamine hit pls lol.

Lastly, what would also be awesome is if you told us in #feedback how you liked this project and the structure of the project. What did you love most about buildspace? What sucked? What would like us to change for future projects? Your feedback would be awesome!

See yah around!!!
