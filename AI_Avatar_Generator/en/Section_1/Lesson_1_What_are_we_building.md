### Putting _______ in your favorite movie scenes

Imagine this: You invite your friends over for movie night. The latest blockbuster hit is out, so you get everything ready: pizza, popcorn, H20. You pull up the TV/projector. The first thing on screen? **YOU**! Before the movie even plays, all your friends are treated to an incredible piece of art depicting *you* as the protagonist. Everyone's gonna remember this one.

Welcome to the world of AI generated art through a sick open source software called “Stable Diffusion”. You’ve probably heard about Dall-e or MidJourney before. These are apps that let you generate images from text. Stable Diffusion is a similar project, except it’s free and open-source — anyone can run it on their own computers!

Open-source models like Stable Diffusion are an absolute game changer - you can use techniques to fine-tune them and combine them with other tech to create extremely accurate depictions of you as *any* character on the internet.

Ever wondered what you'd look like as Patrick Bateman in the 2000 cult classic American Psycho? Batman? Legolas? Shaggy? You can make it happen with Stable Diffusion.

**Here’s the plan**: 

1. We’ll start by learning all about prompts and how this tech works by making a bunch of really cool avatars
2. Next we'll dive into this thing called Dreambooth - a special technique that let’s you **fine-tune** Stable Diffusion on a specific subject (you!) by **teaching** it what you look like
3. We’ll then build an app that uses that model so your friends can use to put you anywhere!

### What are we building?

Here’s a quick overview of what we’ll be doing!

The magic behind our app here is customizing it to YOU. We’re going to get the perfect photos of you with just your laptop (or phone) and train a model that will be able to generate insane AI avatars with a specific theme. This all with just a prompt + click of a button.
