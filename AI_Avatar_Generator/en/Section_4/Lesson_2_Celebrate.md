### Beyond localhost!
**What you’ve learned**
When you’re following a project guide and not doing everything yourself from scratch, it can be easy to forget or overlook what you’ve learned. Here’s a list of all the cool technologies you learned how to use in this project:

1. Dreamstudio
2. Google Colab
3. Jupyter notebooks
4. HuggingFace
5. Text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and Dall-e
6. Next.js

**WOW**. All these tools are now in your arsenal. You can spin up new projects using any of these and I fully expect you to. I better be seeing some tags from you on Twitter when you make even cooler stuff than this app.

Cya around you wizard :)

### Please do this or Raza will be sad
Go ahead and submit your build, and once you do that, you’ll get access to the alumni channels in our Discord. If you have any issues w/ the NFT or alumni access, please ping @tair#5029 and yannik#0886 in #feedback. They'll get you sorted out!

Once you have access to the alumni channels — show us what you built in #showcase! Drop a link to the final web app + a short description of what it is. Also, would love to see it on Twitter! Be sure to tag us, @_buildspace!

Lastly, be sure to introduce yourself in #intros -- the alumni group is huge and people are always looking to connect!
