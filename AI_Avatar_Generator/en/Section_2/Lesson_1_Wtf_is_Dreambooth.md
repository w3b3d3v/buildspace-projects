You’re now well-versed with what Stable Diffusion is and how it works. Except it has one big problem - **you can’t teach it new things**. There’s no way I can give it 10 pictures of my dog and make it generate images of my dog on the bed so I can gaslight him into thinking he broke the rules.

This is where [Dreambooth](https://dreambooth.github.io/) comes in. It's a machine learning technique that lets you generate photorealistic images of specific subjects in a variety of different contexts. 

Stable Diffusion knows everything about the general world - what clouds look like, how bald Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is, and what rainbows are made of. Using Dreambooth, you can teach it what **you** look like too!

### How do Dreambooth + SD work together?

To use Dreambooth, we’ll have to give it some training data: a set of images of ourselves, or whoever we want to generate images of, along with a label (our name) and the class of objects the thing belongs to (human).

Dreambooth then fine-tunes a pre-trained text-to-image model to learn to recognize and generate images of the specific subject.

### How does it work?

Unlike magic, this tech is even cooler when you know the trick. 

We've got the OG Stable Diffusion model. That's not the special part. What's really going to make it ours is the set of input photos we'll use. Here's a simplified flow of how it'll work:

1. The SD model is trained on a dataset of images that represent one subject (you).
2. Using the input photos, the model extracts the key features and characteristics of the faces in the photos.
3. The model uses the extracted features to generate new, synthesized images that resemble the input photos but have their own unique style and variations based on our text.

Soon you’ll be able to turn yourself into Thor (aka Thorza) like I did below

### Training Dreambooth models is a big deal

You know all those fancy AI-style profile pictures you’re seeing on Twitter and Instagram? All of them were generated by fine-tuning SD models using Dreambooth. That’s what Lensa charges $$$ for. All of this is open-source tech that was made available to everyone at the same time, it was all up to the builders to ship fast and get it in front of people. 

While it’s not likely that you’ll be able to make a $50k MRR app overnight by building this out, you’ll know how it works and you’ll be ready to capture the opportunity the next time it arises!
